## 1. Executive Summary

**Goal:**

To predict 2 years (2017-2018, 40 mio~ rows) of electricity usage with 1 year (2016, 20 mio~ rows) of data for training. The evaluation metrics is RMSE.

**Results:** 

LightGBM achieved the lowest RMSE (1.278), about 3.8% less accurate the Kaggle topic winner solution (1.231). Example prediction results for building No. 168 as below:

## 2. About the Project

This project comes from the Kaggle competition [ASHRAE Energy Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction). The goal of this project is straightfoward - How much energy will a building consume?

From the publication <i>More Buildings Make More Generalizable Modelsâ€”Benchmarking Prediction Methods on Open Electrical Meter Data</i>. Clayton Millor pointed out "A period of baseline energy consumption is used to create a machine learning prediction model to evaluate how much energy a building would use in a status quo baseline mode. An energy conservation measure (ECM) is installed and the difference between the baseline is the avoided energy consumption or demand. This process is crucial for the implementation of energy savings implementations as it gives building owners, designers and contractors a means of evaluating the success of such measures."

For this project the host provided the 2016 electricity used data for more than 1000 building across the world, and ask competitors to predict the next two year's meter readings. Then the host is able to obtain best modeling solutions that can be used to predict future savings of the energy after ECM installation.

This project is meaningful because with better estimates of these energy-saving investments, large scale investors and financial institutions will be more inclined to invest in this area to enable progress in building efficiencies.



## 3. The Dataset

The provided data consists of ~20 millions. rows for training (one year timespan) and ~40 mio. rows for testing (two years timespan). The target variable are the hourly readings from one of four meters {0: electricity, 1: chilledwater, 2: steam, hotwater: 3}. For building the model the data provides following features out of the box:


- building_id --> Foreign key for the building metadata.
- meter ---> The meter id code. Read as {0: electricity, 1: chilledwater, 2: steam, hotwater: 3}
- timestamp --> Hour of the measurement
- site_id --> Identifier of the site the building is on
- primary_use ---> Primary category of activities for the building 
- square_feet --> Floor area of the building
- year_built ---> build year of the building
- floorcount - Number of floors of the building

Further weather data has been provided, which comes with air_temperature, cloud_coverage, dew_temperature, precip_depth_1_hr, sea_level_pressure, wind_direction and wind_speed.

## 4. Walk Through the Project

The the project follows the standard workflow of machine learning project:
- Data Preparation
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Prediction & Evaluation

Note: This project run on python >= 3.6



### 4.1. Install Dependencies

    ```
    # 1. Clone the project
    git clone https://github.com/georgehua/energy-consumption-prediction.git
    
    # 2. Install project dependencies
    
    # It's recommended to create a virtual environment first, a good option is to use pipenv package
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv shell
    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
    
    # Or you can install everything gloabally
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```



### 4.2. The Dataset

   The raw data has to be placed in `data/raw`. A good practice is to download the data via the Kaggle CLI.
    ```
    kaggle competitions download -c ashrae-energy-prediction
    mkdir -p data/raw
    unzip ashrae-energy-prediction.zip -d data/raw
    ```



### 4.3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

    ```
    python src/data/preproc.py data data/interim
    ```

   `preproc.py` will create a clean dataframe for analysis. This script includes: 
   - Load all associated `.csv`-files
   - Timestamps alignment based on building location. 
        - The original time is in UTC, we need to align them to their local time because time of the day is crucial to predict energy consumption (consider lightening, heating, etc.)
   - Iterative imputation for missing values in weather data. 
   - Join all dataframes and save compressed results in `data/interim`



### 4.4. Feature Engineering

    ```
    python src/features/build_features.py data data/processed
    ```
    `build_features.py` will conduct the feature engineering process. The result is saved in `data/processed`. This script includes: 
    - Encode all categorical features
    - Encode wind direction (cyclic encoding - cosine)
        - Inspired by: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/148380/use-of-circular-predictors-in-linear-regression
    - Extract time based features (time-series pattern on energy usage)
        - hour
        - weekday
        - month
    - Create new features based on existing information: 
        - area_per_floor
        - log_transformed_square_feet
        - log_transform_area_per_floor
        - age_of_buildings
        - relative_humidity
        - feels_like_temperature
        - add lag windows 6, 24 days
    - Labeling outliers: var < mean - 2.5 * std | var > mean + - 2.5 * std
    - Exlucde wrong readings (data anomly)
    - Drop faulty rows

### 4.5. Build Models

    ```
    python src/models/train_model.py <MODEL_NAME> <MODE> data/processed models/<MODEL_NAME>
    
    # Example:
    python src/models/train_model.py lgbm cv data/processed models/lgbm
    ```
    In this script I set up the training program for three ML models LightGBM, CatBoost and XGBoost. From the experiments, the LightGBM renders the best results. At the end of each training, the models will be safed in the equally named directory.
    - `MODEL_NAME` : 
        - lgbm (LightGBM)
        - ctb (CatBoost)
        - xgb (XGBoost)
    - `MODE`: 
        - cv (cross validation, default, best one)
        - full (no validation set, single fold)
        - by_meter (training by meter type)
        - by_building (training by building id)



### 4.6. Hyperparameter Tuning

   ```
    python src/models/find_hyperparameter_lgbm.py
   ```
   For tuning hyperparameter, I used Bayesian optimization to reduce the time spent on traditional grid-search or random-search.
   Note: This step is time-consuming and requires large RAM space.



### 4.7. Make Predictions

   ```
    python src/models/predict_model.py data/processed <MODEL_NAME> <MODEL_PATH> submissions/submission.csv
   
    # Example:
    python src/models/predict_model.py data/processed lgbm models/lgbm_cv/ submissions/submission.csv
   ```
   Note: the testing set contains 40 millions rows, and requires large memory space to process.

   The result is a `.csv` file, which is dumped in the `submission` directory and is ready for uploading to Kaggle.

   - `MODEL_NAME` : 
        - lgbm (LightGBM)
        - ctb (CatBoost)
        - xgb (XGBoost)
   - `MODEL_PATH`: the directory of the saved models or the model itself.



### 4.8. Evaluation & Prediction

The RMSE score on test set is 1.278, and I consider the result as a success (the winner is 1.231, so my solution is 3.8% less accurate than the top solution). There might be some factors influence the results that out of my control:
- The test set is separated into public and private score board (a convention of the Kaggle competition), and scoring participants separately. But there might be bias during the separation process.
- I didn't use leaked buildings data, but many participants did.

**Shapley Values Plot**

This shows the Shap values on the x-axis. Here, all the values on the left represent the observations that shift the predicted value in the negative direction while the points on the right contribute to shifting the prediction in a positive direction. All the features are on the left y-axis.

So here, high square feet values are on the right side primarily because they contribute positively to the meter readings.

**LightGBM Feature Importance**

The plot uses LightGBM to calculate feature importance and have the similar functionality to Shapley values.

## 5. Data Leaks


Unfortunately a portion of the test labels have been leaked, which stirred the whole competition. Someone located the building in the real world and pulled the actually electricity readings to include in their submission file. And almost all the top winner's solution used the leaked data.
